# Candidate Detail Verifier

A Modern web based verification system that validates candidate information through screening flow with dynamic validation, This tool demonstrates clean validation logic.

## What it does

- Loads candidate data and validates fields like email, phone, etc.
- Walks users through confirming or correcting their info
- Asks additional questions (notice period, experience, location)
- Generates a clean JSON output with verified data

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santhoshkumar0918/Candidate-verifier-app-internai
cd candidate-detail-verifier
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in browser

- Web Interface: http://localhost:3000
- API Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/verify

Enter your candidate details and follow the guided verification process.

## Project Walkthrough

### Step 1: Data Input

- Enter basic candidate info (name, email, phone, availability, skills)
- Shows preview of additional questions that'll be asked later
- Has basic validation before proceeding

### Step 2: Field Verification

- Review each field with clear validation feedback
- Edit any incorrect information inline
- After Reviewed each field , click the confirm button for addtional question section.

### Step 3: Additional Questions

- Answer dynamic questions based on the input configuration
- Supports different question types (text, number, yes/no)
- Required vs optional field handling

### Step 4: Summary & Export

- Review all verified information
- Click Save & download the final JSON output
- Complete the verification process

## API Usage

The app also provides a REST API for programmatic access:

```bash
# Check API status
GET http://localhost:3000/api/verify

# Submit verification data
POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify
Content-Type: application/json
```

}
```

## My Approach

When I got this assignment, I wanted to build something that felt professional and actually usable, not just a tech demo.

**Architecture decisions:**

- Went with Next.js for the full-stack simplicity
- Used TypeScript everywhere because validation is crucial here
- Chose Zustand for lighweight and boilerplate code
- Zod for validation since it plays nicely with TypeScript

**UX thinking:**

- Made it a guided flow instead of one giant form
- Added visual progress so users know where they are
- Inline editing because forcing users to start over is annoying
- Clean, straightforward data entry process

**Technical choices:**

- Kept validation logic separate so it's reusable
- Used proper HTTP status codes in the API
- Made the question system extensible even though the requirements were fixed
- Added error boundaries and proper loading states

## File Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/verify/route.ts     # REST API endpoint
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                # it wraps all our components
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ DataInput.tsx           # Step 1: Basic info
â”œâ”€â”€ FieldVerification.tsx   # Step 2: Confirm fields
â”œâ”€â”€ AdditionalQuestions.tsx # Step 3: Extra questions
â”œâ”€â”€ SummaryScreen.tsx       # Step 4: Review & download
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ store.ts                # State management
â”œâ”€â”€ validation.ts           # All validation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts                # TypeScript definitions
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ input.json
â”œâ”€â”€ output.json
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **State:** Zustand (lightweight)
- **Validation:** Zod schemas
- **API:** Next.js API routes

## Testing

Load the app and enter some candidate details - try entering invalid email formats or short phone numbers to see the validation in action.

For API testing, check out the `input.json` and `output.json` files to see the expected format. and then it the api endpoints with the postman.
